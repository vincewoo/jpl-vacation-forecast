## 2026-01-07 - Excessive Error Detail Leakage
**Vulnerability:** The application was logging raw error objects (including stack traces and potentially sensitive data) to `console.error` in production.
**Learning:** Developers often log full error objects for debugging, but this persists in production builds, exposing internal implementation details and potentially PII in browser console logs.
**Prevention:** Use a centralized logger that conditionally logs details based on the environment or sanitizes error objects to only show messages, preventing stack trace leakage.
